## 2️⃣ Hosting Your Project
GitHub **cannot host** Java Spring Boot directly (it only hosts static HTML/CSS/JS sites).  
👉 To show a **live demo**, you have options:
- **Render** (free, supports Spring Boot)
- **Railway.app** (free plan, easy deployment)
- **Heroku** (limited free usage, needs DB setup)
- **AWS / Azure / GCP** (cloud hosting)

⚡ Best for you: **Render.com** (I can guide step by step).
